# MoodLift
Mental health wellbeing is a major challenge in this modern society where people are so busy 
with their work life. In this concrete world people find less time to check upon their mental 
health, hence many people suffer from different mental health issues. Keeping in mind all 
these problems we decided to develop an android application which would help as an 
assistant to keep up a good mental health. 
The Mental Health Assistant we developed (MoodLift) is an interface which would assist in 
decreasing mental health issues. 
This app aims to decrease mental health issues using different platforms like social media, 
Chatbot, E-books and Guided meditation platform based on audio visualization.
